    "description": "I am a professional Web Developer and a DevOps Architect. I am presently working in one of the largest IT company, worldwide. I am a hobbyist Web Designer and I love exploring Design Philosophies. Enthusiast in Agile and Scrum methodologies, I like being a team motivator and hands-on executioner. This platform is where I want to talk and share my prespectives about the topics that intrigue me. These opinions are purely personal and something that my life has taught me and hence, they may or maynot be aligned to the beliefs or values of the organizations I work in. This initiative is an infant and constructive criticisms are always welcome to help me grow."
